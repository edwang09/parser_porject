# Course Project -- Calculator
## Installation
no compilation or installation required, all dependency is included in this repository
## How to run
run 
```
python calculator.py 
```
and follow command-line instructions
## Limitations
* This calculator currently does not support division. 
* It only takes variables that has only one charactor(e.g. x,y not var, Vs etc.). 
* It does not takes higher degree inputs such as 2x^2. 
* It does not take non-integers such as 3.5 from input.
## Example
```
$ python calculator.py
Please enter the Polynomial you want to calculate(e.g. x + ( 2y + 3 )* ( 3s + 4 ) * 5):
3+e+34d*(4+3s)
Result :

3+e+34d*(4+3s)
 = 102ds + 136d + 1e + 3
```

# HW5 - Run nfa2dfa using node.js:
Please install node.js and run with command "node nfa2dfa".
The NFA object is hardcoded into the js file and result printed to console for simplicity.
